plus we got one on the way\n        She gave me a family to love, for that, I can never repay\n        I'm crying while writing these words\n        The tears, they feel good on my face, hey\n        And yesterday could feel just like a waste, yeah\n        If I don't love you, how I'm supposed to?\n        And yesterday could feel just like a waste, yeah\n        If I don't love you, how I'm supposed to?\n        I make sacrifices, bloody sacrifices"

        "lyrics": "I let it fall, my heart\n        And as it fell, you rose to claim it\n        It was dark and I was over\n        Until you kissed my lips and you saved me\n        My hands, they were strong\n        But my knees were far too weak\n        To stand in your arms\n        Without falling to your feet\n        But there's a side to you\n        That I never knew, never knew\n        All the things you'd say\n        They were never true, never true\n        And the games you'd play\n        You would always win, always win\n        But I set fire to the rain\n        Watched it pour as I touched your face\n        Well, it burned while I cried\n        'Cause I heard it screaming out your name\n        Your name\n        When laying with you\n        I could stay there\n        Close my eyes, feel you here forever\n        You and me together, nothing is better\n        'Cause there's a side to you\n        That I never knew, never knew\n        All the things you'd say\n        They were never true, never true\n        And the games you'd play\n        You would always win, always win\n        But I set fire to the rain\n        Watched it pour as I touched your face\n        Well, it burned while I cried\n        'Cause I heard it screaming out your name\n        Your name\n        I set fire to the rain\n        And I threw us into the flames\n        When we fell, something died\n        'Cause I knew that that was the last time\n        The last time\n        Sometimes I wake up by the door\n        That heart you caught must be waiting for you\n        Even now when we're already over\n        I can't help myself from looking for you\n        I set fire to the rain\n        Watched it pour as I touch your face\n        Well, it burned while I cried\n        'Cause I heard it screaming out your name\n        Your name\n        I set fire to the rain\n        And I threw us into the flames\n        When we fell, something died\n        'Cause I knew that that was the last time\n        The last time, oh\n        Oh, no\n        Let it burn, oh-oh-oh\n        Let it burn\n        Let it burn"
