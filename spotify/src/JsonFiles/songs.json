    Let's focus on communicatin' 'cause
    I just need the time and place to come through
    (A place to come through)
    Send me your location
    Let's ride the vibrations
    I don't need nothin' else but you (I don't need nothin' else but)
    
    At times I wonder why I fool with you
    But this is new to me, this is new to you
    Initially, I didn't wanna fall for you
    Gather my attention it was all for you, so don't
    Take advantage, don't leave my heart damaged
    To understand that things go a little bit better when you plan it
    
    So won't you send me, your location 
    Let's focus on communicatin' 'cause
    I just need the time and place to come through
    Send me your location 
    Let's ride the vibrations
    I don't need nothing else but you (I don't need nothin' else)
    
    I don't wanna fall in love off of subtweets so
    Let's get personal
    I got a lot of cool spots that we can go
    Tell me what's the move and I got you
    I'm only acting like this 'cause I like you
    Just give me the vibe to slide then
    Oh, I might make you mine by the night
    
    Send me your location 
    Let's focus on communicatin' 'cause
    I just need the time and place to come through

    Send me your location 
    Let's ride the vibrations
    I don't need nothing else but you (I don't need nothin' else but you)
    
    Ride, ride, ride, come and vibe with me tonight
    I don't need nothing else but you
    (I don't need nothing else but you)
    Ride, ride, ride, come and vibe with me tonight
    I don't need nothing else but you
    Nothing else but you

    That you found a girl and you're married now
    I heard that your dreams came true
    Guess she gave you things, I didn't give to you
    Old friend, why are you so shy?
    Ain't like you to hold back or hide from the light
    I hate to turn up out of the blue, uninvited
    But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it
    I had hoped you'd see my face
    And that you'd be reminded that for me, it isn't over
    Never mind, I'll find someone like you
    I wish nothing but the best for you, too
    Don't forget me,  I beg
    I remember you said
    Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead
    Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead
    You know how the time flies
    Only yesterday was the time of our lives
    We were born and raised in a summer haze
    Bound by the surprise of our glory days
    I hate to turn up out of the blue, uninvited
    But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it
    I had hoped you'd see my face
    And that you'd be reminded that for me, it isn't over
    Never mind, I'll find someone like you
    I wish nothing but the best for you, too
    Don't forget me,  I begged
    I remember you said
    Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead
    Nothing compares, no worries or cares
    Regrets and mistakes, they're memories made
    Who would have known how bittersweet this would taste?
    Never mind, I'll find someone like you
    I wish nothing but the best for you
    Don't forget me,  I beg
    I remember you said
    Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead

        Two feet creep up the road
        To photo, to record, meat lumps and war
        They advance as does his chance, ohh
        Very yellow-white flash
        A violent wrench grips mass
        Rips light, tears limbs like rags
        Burst so high, finally Capa lands
        Mine is a watery pit
        Painless with immense distance
        From medic, from colleague, friend, enemy, foe
        Him five yards from his leg
        From you Taro, oh
        Do not spray into eyes
        I have sprayed you into my eyes
        3:10 p.m.
        Capa pends death, quivers, last rattles, last chokes
        All colours and cares glaze to grey
        Shriveled and stricken to dots
        The left hand grasps what the body grasps not, ohh
        Le photographe est mort
        3.1415, alive no longer my amour
        Faded for home May of '54
        Doors open like arms, my love
        Painless with a great closeness
        To Capa, to Capa Capa dark after nothing
        Re-united with his leg
        And with you, Taro, oh
        Taro, ohh
        Do not spray into eyes
        I have sprayed you into my eyes

    My love is killing my libido

    Who got shot, who's the one standing still? Woo

    You got nothing to say
    What do you want to do
    About me and you?
    You can smile or laugh
    But it's less then half
    Of what makes a whole
    So make the call
    You keep spitting in my face
    I'm a rat in your race
    And your hand is full of lies
    But you're my love in disguise
    Who got shot, who's the one standing still?
    Give me some time to forget and a reason to forgive
    Who got shot, who's the one standing still?
    Maybe I'll come back, might be able to believe

    Chest always so puffed guy
    I'm that bad type
    Make your mama sad type
    Make your girlfriend mad tight
    Might seduce your dad type
    I'm the bad guy, duh
    I'm the bad guy
    I like it when you take control
    Even if you know that you don't
    Own me, I'll let you play the role
    I'll be your animal
    My mommy likes to sing along with me
    But she won't sing this song
    If she reads all the lyrics
    She'll pity the men I know
    So you're a tough guy
    Like it really rough guy
    Just can't get enough guy
    Chest always so puffed guy
    I'm that bad type
    Make your mama sad type
    Make your girlfriend mad tight
    Might seduce your dad type
    I'm the bad guy, duh
    I'm the bad guy, duh
    I'm only good at being bad, bad
    I like when you get mad
    I guess I'm pretty glad that you're alone
    You said she's scared of me?
    I mean, I don't see what she sees
    But maybe it's 'cause I'm wearing your cologne
    I'm a bad guy
    I'm, I'm a bad guy
    Bad guy, bad guy
    I'm a bad"

        And we try to make it work
        But it still ends up the worst
        And I'm craaazzzy
        For tryin to be your laaadddy
        I think I'm goin crazy
        Girl, me and you we're just fine (you know)
        We wined and dined
        Did them things that couples do when in love (you know)
        Walks on the beach and stuff (you know)
        Things that lovers say and do
        I love you boo, I love you too
        I miss you a lot, I miss you even more
        That's why I flew you out
        When we was on tour
        But then something got out of hand
        You start yellin when I was with my friends
        Even though I had legitimate reasons (bull shit)
        You know I had to make them dividends (bull shit)
        How could you trust our private eyes girl
        That's why you don't believe my lies
        And quit this lecture
        Shut up
        Just shut up
        Shut up
        Shut it up, just shut up, shut up

        And I'm craaazzzy
        For tryin to be your laaadddy
        I think I'm goin crazy
        Why does emotion gotta move so fast
        Love is progress if you could make it last
        Why is it that you just lose control
        Every time you agree on takin it slow
        Why does it got to be so damn tough
        Cuz fools in lust could never get enough of love
        Showin the love that you be givin
        Changing up your livin
        For a lovin transition
        Girl its a mission tryin to get you to listen
        We mad at each other has become our tradition
        You yell, I yell, everybody yells
        Got the neighbors across the street saying
        Who the hell?!?
        Who the hell?
        What the hell's going down?
        Too much of the bickering
        Kill it with the sound and
        Shut up

    The body that lies is built up on looking

    A heart will swell before it's hardened
    With the flick of the hair, it can make you old

    I'll leave anything bare that keeps me soul
    
    A physical kiss is nothing without it
    And you close your eyes to see what is done
    The body that lies is built up on looking

    Hollow talking and hollow girl
    Force it up from the root of pain
    Never said it was good, never said it was near
    Shadow rises and you are here
    And then you cut
    You cut it out
    And everything
    Goes back to the beginning
    Silence seizes a cluttered room
    Light is shed not a breath too soon
    Darkness rises in all you do
    Standing and drawn across the room
    Spatial movements are butterflies
    Shadows scatter without a fire
    There's never been bad, there has always been truth
    Muted whisper of the things she'll move
    And then you cut
    You cut it out
    And everything

    Never said it was good, never said it was new

        If you had
        One shot
        Or one opportunity
        To seize everything you ever wanted
        In one moment
        Would you capture it
        Or just let it slip?
        Yo
        His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
        There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti
        He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready
        To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgettin'
        What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
        He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
        He's chokin', how, everybody's jokin' now
        The clocks run out, times up, over, blaow
        Snap back to reality, ope there goes gravity
        Ope, there goes Rabbit, he choked
        He's so mad, but he won't give up that easy? No
        He won't have it, he knows his whole back's to these ropes
        It don't matter, he's dope, he knows that, but he's broke
        He's so stagnant, he knows, when he goes back to this mobile home, that's when it's
        Back to the lab again, yo, this whole rhapsody
        Better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him
        You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
        You own it, you better never let it go
        You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
        This opportunity comes once in a lifetime
        You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
        You own it, you better never let it go
        You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
        This opportunity comes once in a lifetime
        You better
        His soul's escaping, through this hole that is gaping
        This world is mine for the taking
        Make me king, as we move toward a New World Order
        A normal life is borin', but super stardom's close to post mortem
        It only grows harder, only grows hotter
        He blows, it's all over, these hoes is all on him
        Coast to coast shows, he's known as the Globetrotter
        Lonely roads, God only knows, he's grown farther from home, he's no father
        He goes home and barely knows his own daughter
        But hold your nose 'cause here goes the cold water
        These hoes don't want him no mo', he's cold product
        They moved on to the next schmo who flows, he nose dove and sold nada
        So the soap opera is told and unfolds, I suppose it's old partna, but the beat goes on
        Da-da-dum, da-dum, da-da
        You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
        You own it, you better never let it go
        You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
        This opportunity comes once in a lifetime
        You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
        You own it, you better never let it go
        You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
        This opportunity comes once in a lifetime
        You better
        No more games, I'ma change what you call rage
        Tear this motherfuckin' roof off like two dogs caged
        I was playin' in the beginnin', the mood all changed
        I been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
        But I kept rhymin' and stepped right in the next cypher
        Best believe somebody's payin' the Pied Piper
        All the pain inside amplified by the
        Fact that I can't get by with my nine to
        Five and I can't provide the right type of
        Life for my family 'cause man, these goddamn food stamps don't buy diapers
        And its no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer
        This is my life and these times are so hard
        And it's getting even harder tryna feed and water my seed, plus
        Teeter totter, caught up between bein' a father and a prima donna
        Baby mama drama, screamin' on her, too much
        For me to wanna stay in one spot, another day of monotony's
        Gotten me to the point, I'm like a snail I've got
        To formulate a plot or end up in jail or shot
        Success is my only motherfuckin' option, failure's not
        Mom, I love you, but this trailer's got to go, I cannot grow old in Salem's Lot
        So here I go, is my shot
        Feet, fail me not, this may be the only opportunity that I got
        You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
        You own it, you better never let it go
        You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
        This opportunity comes once in a lifetime
        You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
        You own it, you better never let it go
        You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
        This opportunity comes once in a lifetime
        You better
        You can do anything you set your mind to, man"

        Put myself to sleep
        Just so I can get closer to you inside my dreams
        Didn't wanna wake up 'less you were beside me

        I know I made you fall

        I lied to you, I lied to you, I lied to you (To you)
        Can't hide the truth, I'd stay with her in spite of you

        I'm loving your light, vulnerable
        Letting your guard down is honorable
        'Specially when the past ain't been that friendly to you, but there's magic in that
        You the flower that I gotta protect
        And keep alive in the wintertime, hey, don't you die yet
        You been way more than a friend of mine, we more like fam
        I raised you, you raised me, let's turn this whole life 'round
        You can confide in me
        I can take the weight up off your shoulder blades and try to store the pain inside of me
        Like, why the world do you like that?
        Like they don't know you, God sent, but me, I view you like that
        I'm sneaking glances, thanking God that he drew you like that
        Beautiful black child, come and shed your black cloud
        For your vibe and your smile I don't mind a lil' rain
        I'm your dog, ears perk up at the sound of your name
        Counting your main, wildfire, can't handle your flame
        Download your strain, wild high, come drown in your fragrance
        You that red pill that a nigga found in Matrix
        Before I had you this shit was fantasy
        You plant a seed, it grows some roots, a branch and leaves
        Becomes a tree of life until our nights are filled
        With peace from stress and strife
        And that's the blessin' that I get from wifing you
        'Cause you entrusted me with the key to your heartbeat, and you smart
        'Cause even though I need a new start
        Due to my past transgressions you believed in me
        I guess the light I see in you is what you see in me, Lord
        Bet she from the West Side, mmm
        And she see my Best Side, mmm, mmm
        Now I just wanna know
        Don't just sugar coat
        Or say it all if you want
        Now could you tell me like it is?

        I always knew life can be dangerous
        I can say that I like a challenge and you tell me it's painless
        You don't know what pain is
        How can I paint this picture
        When the color blind is hanging with ya?
        Fell on my face and I woke with a scar
        Another mistake living deep in my heart
        Wear it on top of my sleeve in a flick
        I can admit that it did look like yours
        Why you resent every making of this?
        Tell me your purpose is petty again

        Even a small lighter can burn a bridge

        I can feel the new people 'round me just want to be famous
        You can see that my city found me put me on stages
        To me that's amazing
        To you that's a quick check, with all disrespect let me say this

        You trying to keep it deprived and only co-sign what radio does
        And I'm looking right past ya
        We live in a world, we live in a world on two different axles
        You live in a world, you living behind the mirror
        I know what you scared of, the feeling of feeling emotions inferior
        This shit is vital, I know you had to
        This shit is vital, I know you had to
        Die in a pitiful vain, tell me a watch and a chain
        Is way more believable, give me a feasible gain
        Rather a seasonal name, I'll let the people know this is something you can blame
        On yourselves you can remain, stuck in a box

        Don't you see that long line?
        And they waiting on Kendrick like the first and the fifteenth
        3's in the air I can see you are in sync
        Hide your feelings, hide your feelings now what you better do

        Play your games like they my ticket to an Ivy league school
        Won't get hall of fame dick from a minor league dude
        I just eat pussy, other people need food
        Only got a little time, I ain't tryna spend it
        Arguing about who ain't giving who attention
        Starting up the engine, need to reboot
        I just eat pussy, other people need food
        And I ain't used every bone in my body
        Keep on holding on to your trust
        I know you don't want nothin' to do with me
        But just one more time, let's make love
        One more time it ain't much
        Fuck 'em all, let's be us, summer's soft sweetness
        Heartache drunk and hang up
        What a mess I made us, sense, I make none
        It's complicated, keeping me up late
        Can't concentrate, you're always on my brain
        If it's love then why the fuck you complain?
        I just think that's some bullshit
        Okay, it's seems inviting, trust me, she's a titan
        This week she like him, next week they fightin'
        Need protection, all your dress is bulletproof
        You safe with me girl
        I can't keep on losing you
        Where the hell you going?
        Where you taking this trip to? (Wait)
        Don't want, don't think too
        I can't keep on losing you
        Where the hell you going?
        Wait
        Where the hell you going?
        I can't keep on losing you
        Over complications
        Gone too soon
        Wait, we was just hangin'
        I guess I need to hold onto, dang
        The people that know me best
        The key that I won't forget, too soon
        I can't keep on losing you
        Can't keep losing you
        I can't keep losing you

        To get things off the ground
        And it was up, up and away

        Well, now then, mardy bum
        Oh, I'm in trouble again, aren't I?
        I thought as much
        'Cause you turned over there
        Pulling that silent disappointment face
        The one that I can't bare
        Well, can't we just laugh and joke around?
        Remember cuddles in the kitchen, yeah

        And I can't be arsed to carry on in this debate
        That reoccurs, oh, when you say I don't care
        But, of course I do, yeah, I clearly do
        So laugh and joke around?

        When you leave, I'm begging you not to go
        Call your name two, three times in a row
        Such a funny thing for me to try to explain
        How I'm feeling and my pride is the one to blame

        Tennis shoes, don't even need to buy a new dress
        If you ain't there, ain't nobody else to impress
        It's the way that you know what I thought I knew
        It's the beat that my heart skips when I'm with you

        Of course I (of course I), I divorce my (divorce my)
        Opinion on advance when you walk past
        (On bro, that shit groovy, I made it)
        Niggas pull strings like a guitar
        Guitar, G-Star jeans on my sneakers
        I'm a real soulful nigga
        Collared greens inside your speakers (yeah, yeah)
        Ferguson days on Castro
        Wasn't no cash flow
        But I'm good for the arch, I'm Dr. Scholl's
        I'm good for your whore, let me snatch your soul, soul, soul
        Bloody sacrifices
        Yeah, ay, look at what a motherfucker do for the cash intake
        They'll be right across your head like it's Ash Wednesday
        You got to just get off your ass like your ass is fake
        You can't sit, and if we ain't siblings, then I can't relate
        Today's shit, I'm Asic, I run shit, I got it jumpin' like pump fake
        I don't need nothing but one take
        I'm from the part of the city
        Where young nigga keep him a nine like one plus eight
        Our politician a fuckface
        Corrupt like a Dogg Pound Gangsta
        We do it like a small town wager
        How I'm the dropout major
        Success stories, I favor
        Used to cover my scars, out here tryna cover The Fader
        Yeah, Pro Tools, knobs, and the faders
        Tail picks, as-salamu alaykum
        You ain't 'bout static like AM radio, ain't even playin'
        I put my heart and my all in my art, I'm alternate
        All of them are the same, it's harder to tell 'em apart some days
        I thought I'd call 'em out altogether
        Rather than waste the amount of bars it'll take for me to call 'em out by name
        Caught a glimpse of the alternate world I've introduced to you
        Via the studio, got 'em studying our mixtape
        I'm from the hood like my mama, put that on my mama
        I lay the law down like parliament, all just with a pen and page
        I make sacrifices, bloody sacrifices
        You can't be everything to everybody
        I wanna be your lover, your best friend
        Your Batman, Spiderman
        Fight to polish who and now your rival's in
        I wanna damn near kill you to be the one that heal you up
        I wanna be the one that feel you up
        On nights when you need good dick to cheer you up
        I wanna be the one to build you up
        A wall worth five billion bucks to keep out the rah-rah
        And the blah-blah-blah so nobody try to steal your thunder
        Pull you under
        Toss my hopes out, Royal Rumble
        We done moved out to the Boondocks
        Built a big house, there he wonders
        How somewhere along the way
        He went from Huey to Eddie Wuncler
        I been so disconnected, my perspective is ignorant
        When you rich, niggas don't wanna correct you
        Say something crazy, they won't interject
        Do every drug that you want, they gon' let you
        Dangerous when it's nobody to check you
        I be havin' to check myself
        Nigga, stop holding that money, you know you got plenty
        I be havin' to spread my wealth
        I used to be at the crib myself
        Seven years old, off of Bragg Boulevard
        Where they bag up the raw
        They gon' stand on the corner, one hand on they balls
        And they ran when the cops come, there go the laws
        Then I packed up a bag and I trapped it up North on the path of a star
        And I ran into you like I met you before
        Now damn, me and you goin' half on a boy, sing
        Huggin' the block, huggin' the block all day
        I had nowhere to go, she gave me a place to stay
        She gave me her heart to hold, I still got that shit to this day
        She ridin' with me on the road, she ridin' with me in the A
        Huggin' the block, huggin' the block, okay
        She gave me the gift of my son, and plus we got one on the way
        She gave me a family to love, for that, I can never repay
        I'm crying while writing these words
        The tears, they feel good on my face, hey
        And yesterday could feel just like a waste, yeah
        If I don't love you, how I'm supposed to?
        And yesterday could feel just like a waste, yeah
        If I don't love you, how I'm supposed to?
        I make sacrifices, bloody sacrifices"

        For real, you the only father that I ever knew
        I get my bitch pregnant I'ma be a better you
        Prophesies that I made way back in the Ville
        Fulfilled, listen even back when we was broke my team ill
        Martin Luther King would have been on Dreamville
        Talk to a nigga
        One time for my LA sisters
        One time for my LA hoes
        Lame niggas can't tell the difference
        One time for a nigga who knows
        Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
        No role models and I'm here right now
        No role models to speak of
        Searchin' through my memory, my memory
        I couldn't find one
        Last night I was gettin' my feet rubbed
        By the baddest bitch, not Trina, but I swear to God
        This bitch will make you call your girl up and tell her Hey, what's good?
        Sorry I'm never comin' home I'ma stay for good
        Then hang the phone up, and proceed to lay the wood
        I came fast like 9-1-1 in white neighborhoods
        Ain't got no shame bout it
        She think I'm spoiled and I'm rich cause I can have any bitch
        I got defensive and said Nah, I was the same without it
        But then I thought back, back to a better me
        Before I was a B-list celebrity
        Before I started callin' bitches bitches so heavily
        Back when you could get a platinum plaque without no melody
        You wasn't sweatin' me
        One time for my LA sisters
        One time for my LA hoes
        Lame niggas can't tell the difference
        One time for a nigga who knows
        Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
        I want a real love, dark skinned and Aunt Viv love
        That Jada and that Will love
        That leave a toothbrush at your crib love
        And you ain't gotta wonder whether that's your kid love
        Nigga I don't want no bitch from reality shows
        Out of touch with reality hoes
        Out in Hollywood bringin' back 5 or 6 hoes
        Fuck em' then we kick em' to the door
        Nigga you know how it go
        She deserved that, she a bird, it's a bird trap
        You think if I didn't rap she would flirt back
        Takin' off her skirt, let her wear my shirt before she leave
        I'ma need my shirt back
        Nigga you know how it go
        One time for my LA sisters
        One time for my LA hoes
        Lame niggas can't tell the difference
        One time for a nigga who knows
        Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
        Fool me one time shame on you
        Fool me twice, can't put the blame on you
        Fool me three times, fuck the peace signs
        Load the chopper, let it rain on you
        Fool me one time shame on you
        Fool me twice, can't put the blame on you
        Fool me three times, fuck the peace signs
        Load the chopper, let it rain on you
        My only regret was too young for Lisa Bonet
        My only regret was too young for Nia Long
        Now all I'm left with is hoes from reality shows
        Hand her a script the bitch probably couldn't read along
        My only regret was too young for Sade Adu
        My only regret could never take Aaliyah home
        Now all I'm left with is hoes up in Greystone
        With the stale face cause they know it's they song
        She shallow but the pussy deep (she shallow, she shallow)
        Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved"

        And as it fell, you rose to claim it
        It was dark and I was over
        Until you kissed my lips and you saved me
        My hands, they were strong

        'Cause I knew that that was the last time
        The last time
        Sometimes I wake up by the door
        That heart you caught must be waiting for you
        Even now when we're already over
        I can't help myself from looking for you
        I set fire to the rain
        Watched it pour as I touch your face
        Well, it burned while I cried
